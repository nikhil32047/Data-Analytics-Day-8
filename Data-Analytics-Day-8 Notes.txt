1️⃣ Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics:
=========================================
Summary:

Descriptive: Summarizes data (mean, median, mode).

Inferential: Draws conclusions from samples (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests).

Example:

Descriptive: Average customer rating is 4.3 stars.

Inferential: 95% sure that the average rating of all users is between 4.1 and 4.5.

2️⃣ Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode):
======================================
Summary:

Mean: Average

Median: Middle value

Mode: Most frequent value

Example:
Salaries: ₹25k, ₹30k, ₹35k, ₹50k, ₹1,00,000

Mean = skewed due to ₹1 lakh

Median = better for typical salary

3️⃣ Measures of Dispersion (Range, Variance, Std. Deviation):
======================================
Summary:

Range = Max - Min

Variance = Avg of squared deviations

Std. Deviation = Square root of variance

Example:
Used to understand volatility in stock prices or consistency in exam scores.

4️⃣ Data Cleaning with Python (Handling Duplicates & Nulls):
======================================
Summary:

Remove df.duplicated()

Fill/Drop nulls with df.dropna(), df.fillna()

Example:

Fill missing sales values with average.

Drop users with no email info.

5️⃣ GroupBy in Pandas
==================
Summary:
Group data and apply aggregation.

Example:

df.groupby('region')['sales'].sum()
Total sales per region.

6️⃣ Crosstab vs Pivot Table in Pandas:
=============================
Summary:

Crosstab: Frequency counts

Pivot Table: Aggregation with flexibility

Example:
Crosstab: Orders by Gender vs Product
Pivot Table: Avg spending by Month vs Category

7️⃣ Box Plot Interpretation:
=====================
Summary:

Shows distribution + outliers

Line = median

Dots = outliers

Example:
Box plot of salaries can reveal extreme earners.

8️⃣ Histogram Interpretation:
=======================
Summary:

Shows frequency distribution

Good for skewness, modality

Example:
Histogram of customer ages shows that most fall between 25–35.

9️⃣ Bar Chart vs Column Chart:
========================
Summary:

Bar = horizontal

Column = vertical

Use for comparing categories

Example:
Sales by product — column.
Survey answers — bar.

🔟 Data Formatting in Excel (Dates, Currency, %, Text):
=======================================================
Summary:

Format cells: Home > Number

Clean imported messy data

Example:
Converting "01/08/25" to readable date or ₹10000.00 to ₹10,000

🔢 BONUS: Power BI Data Types & Formatting:
===========================================
Summary:

Define correct types (Date, Text, Decimal)

Use formatting for clarity

Example:

Date columns to timelines

Sales as ₹ currency
